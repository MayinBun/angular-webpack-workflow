## Installation

To use it, just clone this repo and install the npm dependencies:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Foxandxss/angular-webpack-workflow my_app

```

## Scripts

All scripts are run with `npm run [script]`, for example: `npm run test`.

* `build` - generate a minified build to dist folder
* `dev` - start development server, try it by opening `http://localhost:8080/`
* `test` - run all tests
* `test:live` - continuously run unit tests watching for changes

See what each script does by looking at the `scripts` section in [package.json](./package.json).
